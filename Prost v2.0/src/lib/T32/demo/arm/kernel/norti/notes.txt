Note on Stack Coverage:
- Stack coverage is only available, if the kernel is 
  compiled with "ERC" defined
- the stack fill pattern needs to be changed in the
  stack initialization in noknl4.c: v4_cre_tsk()
  at the end of the function, right before:
      do { *p++ = ptn; } while (--stksz != 0);
  add the line:
      ptn=0x00;   /* TRACE32 default stack check pattern */
