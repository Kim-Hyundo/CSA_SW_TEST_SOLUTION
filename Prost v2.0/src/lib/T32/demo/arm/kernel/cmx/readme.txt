CMX-RTX Awareness

This directory contains a TRACE32 specific CMX-RTX awareness
that is outdated and no longer maintained. Instead, CMX supports 
the OSEK-ORTI standard to provide kernel awareness in debuggers.
Please see http://www.cmx.com/cmxkaware.htm.
In TRACE32, please use the ORTI awareness for CMX-RTX.
See the document in the TRACE32 installation folder, pdf/rtos_orti.pdf.
