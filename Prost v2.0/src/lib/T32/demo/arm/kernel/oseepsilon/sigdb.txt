sigdb.pl: Perl script to generate union over all signals

Usage: sigdb.pl *.sig >all_sig.c

When double-clicking on the address of a signal inside the 
TASK.DQueue window, the Debugger tries to display the 
signal as union ALL_SIGNALS over all signal structures.
The perl script sigdb.pl generates this union automatically
and writes it into a file called all_sig.c. This C file
must be linked into your application.
