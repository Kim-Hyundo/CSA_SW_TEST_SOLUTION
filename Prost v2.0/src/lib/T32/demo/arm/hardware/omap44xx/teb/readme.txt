TEB board

The TEB board is internally used by Texas Instruments.

See ti_scripts.zip provided at the Pandaboard folder. The scripts can be used
for this board and there is a start-up guide included describing how to use 
the scripts and our tools.

You probably need an adapter to connect our tools:
LA-3812 "Converter OMAP4XXX to MIPI-60"
