Blaze Mobile Development Platform (MDP)

The Blaze board is an OMAP4430 based development platform. We have not yet used it but we know
some customers are successfully working with it with our tools.

Link to the board provider: http://www.svtronics.com/market_omap

See all the information we provided for the Pandaboard. Since the chip is the same most of the
information will apply for the Blaze board as well.

Note that other as the Pandaboard the Blaze board natively has the MIPI 60 connector!
You need to consider this for tool connection. You might need converters or probes with other
default connectors.
